# Lychrel_number
Iterative process of adding numbers with their palindrome in order to end up with a new palindrome, or not... (Lychrel number).

## What does the algorithm do ?
- x is an integer positive number
- We add this number with its palindrome (its mirror).
- If the result is a palindrome, the iteration process stops
- If the result is not a palindrome, we add this result with its palindrome. This iterative process is repeated as long as the 
result is not a palindrome.
- The function returns a list containing the intermediate calculation steps until obtaining the palindrome
- By default (`detailed = False`), only the result of intermediate operations is added to the list, but a more detailed display of the 
calculations is possible by setting `detailed = True`, in this case, each addition and its result appear in tulps.

Exemple with 192 : 192+291 = 483, 483+384 = 867, 867+768 = 1635, 1635+5361 = 6996
- `detailed = False` : [483, 867, 1635, 6996]
- `detailed = True` : [(192, 291, 483), (483, 384, 867), (867, 768, 1635), (1635, 5361, 6996)]

## What's a Lychrel number ?
There are some numbers for which this iterative process does not end, i.e. the algorithm cannot result in a palindrome in a 
reasonable time. 196 is on of them, for this value supercomputers reached 1 billion-digit numbers without reaching the palindrome, 
these numbers are called Lychrel numbers. There are other numbers like this: 295, 394, 493, 592, 689 ...

In this algorithm, in order to avoid endless loops, a duration in seconds is allocated to the calculation, beyond this allotted 
time the process stops, meaning that the number inserted is potentially a Lychrel number. By default the allotted time is `wd = 5`, 
i.e. 5 seconds
